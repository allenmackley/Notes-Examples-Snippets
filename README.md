This is a place where I'm keeping all of my notes, code examples, and snippets.

* Notes on language features.
* Notes on language differences.
* Notes on frameworks and tools and when to considering using them.
* Common commands.
* Install instructions.
* Common patterns and snippets.
* Simple code structures to get started.
* Simple solutions to common problems.
* Study material and reminders for tests.
* Examples for teaching others and helping them get up and going quicker.

Some of the bullet points in the READMEs may be generalizations, but they're useful to help me remember certain concepts.

I have a folder for each language, with a sub-folder for each topic, mini-project, or group of resources.
